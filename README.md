Turnable
========

A Unity and Godot compatible gramework written in C# that can be used to create any kind of turn based game. 

What makes Turnable different from others of its kind? Well, once fleshed out, the Framework will support the following features:

* Plug and Play Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    * Monte Carlo Simulations based AI 
    * Goal based AI
    * State Machines
    * IQ based AI difficulty
* Pathfinding
* Line of Sight (LoS)
* Tiled (TMX) support
* Skills, Stats, Inventories etc.

I've started development on this framework again!
